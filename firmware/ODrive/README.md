## ODrive Usage On Hangprinter

Use stock ODrive Firmware version 0.5.1.
I have not been able to make later versions work.
I have tested 0.5.2 and 0.5.4.

Use a <a href="https://odriverobotics.com/shop/usb-isolator">USB isolator</a> between your laptop and your ODrive.

[The official ODrive docs](https://docs.odriverobotics.com/) are helpful in explaining many of the commands.

### How to Configure

Read every line of `configure_odrive.py`, including the comments manually before executing any of them.
Most of it can be copy/pasted in blocks, but in some places you have to wait.
