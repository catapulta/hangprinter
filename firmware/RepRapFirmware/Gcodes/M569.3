This causes the RepRap machine to report its current motor encoder positions to the host in units of arc degrees (1/360'ths of turns), relative to some reference position that you set with the <code>S</code> parameter.

Before the first call with the <code>S</code> parameter, the reference is unknown and arbitrary.

;Parameters
:<code>Pn</code> or <code>Pn.n</code> Motor driver number, or board address and driver number. Several (remote) drivers may be specified, separated by colon. No more than number of visible axes, as specified by <code>M584 P</code> parameter, are allowed.
:<code>S</code> Sets an encoder reference point. Current and subsequent <code>M569.3 Pn.n</code> calls returns numbers that are relative to the <code>M569.3 Pn.n S</code> call.

If <code>P</code> is not supplied, an error is returned.

A maximum of four CAN-connected drivers can be reached with <code>M569.3</code> counting from machine boot. CAN addresses that fail to respond don't count towards this maximum.
