This causes the RepRap machine to report its current motor encoder positions to the host.
The encoder positions are relative to a reference position.
The reference position is set by sending M114.1 S at any time before sending M114.1 (without any parameters).
If M114.1 is sent to the machine before any M114.1 S command was sent,
the reference position could be any fixed value.

The returned encoder position is in arc degrees (1/360'ths of turns).

;Parameters
:<code>S</code> Subsequent M114.1 calls returns numbers that are relative to the previous M114.1 S call

;Examples
 M114.1
<tt>[-155.28, -4089.60, 6842.04, 0.00, ],</tt>

 M114.1 S
 M114.1
<tt>[0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, ],</tt>
 ; Rotate the first encoder by a full turn
 M114.1
<tt>[360.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, ],</tt>

;Notes
M114.1 is used in the Hangprinter's auto anchor location calibration sequence.
<sup>1</sup> M114.1 will be implemented as a macro on top of RepRapFirmware 3.4+, and use M569.3 (read driver encoder) internally.
