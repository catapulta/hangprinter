Tell one or more motor drivers to apply a specified torque regardless of position.

;Parameters
:<code>Pn</code> or <code>Pn.n</code> Motor driver number, or board address and driver number
:<code>Tn</code> Where n is the mode/torque to apply.

If no parameter is supplied then no action is taken.
The driver is put back into position mode by requesting a torque of exactly 0.
Torque is interpreted as having units of Nm.
Several different driver/torque pairs may be set by specifying them in sequence.

;Examples
 M569.2 P2 T-1.0      ; Sets driver 2 into torque mode with -1.0 Nm of torque.
 M569.2 P0 T1.5 P2 T0 ; Sets driver 0 into torque mode with 1.5 Nm of torque, and sets driver 2 into position mode.

;Notes
Hangprinter's "torque mode" will be implemented as a ReprapFirmware macro that depends on M569.2.

<sup>1</sup> Planned for RepRapFirmware 3.4.
