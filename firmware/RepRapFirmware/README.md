The RepRapFirmware published here is to help those who intend to help develop it.
The final Hangprinter v4 Prototype 2 and onwards will use stock ReprapFirmware.

## Duet3 Firmware
Is under development, and development binaries will be uploaded here from time to time.
There are no guarantees here that the binaries uploaded here are tested, or will work
for you in any particular way.
Use only if you know what you're doing.

Stock ReprapFirmware, that will be part of Hangprinter long term, is developed here:

## Duet2 Firmware
This one was used by the Hangprinter 4 Prototype 1.
It used a Duet2 (Wifi) board and custom firmware.
It is deprecated and should not be used.
