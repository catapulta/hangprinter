Make individual stls on your own by
 * Opening up the scad-files with OpenSCAD GUI and exporting from there

Or with `make`
 * `make stl/<thefileyouwant.stl>`
 * `make <thefileyouwant.stl>`,

... which will both place the stl inside the `hangprinter/stl/` directory.

Make all the stls on your own by
 * `make all` (this will take a long time),
